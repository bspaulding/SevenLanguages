h1. Seven Languages in Seven Weeks

This project represents the exercises from Bruce Tate's book, "Seven Languages in Seven Weeks".

h2. How To Use:

# If you do not already have a free GitHub account, please create one.
# Email Brad Spaulding with your github username, and he'll add you as a contributor.
# Navigate to https://github.com/bspaulding/SevenLanguages and copy your ssh/read-write url.
# Check out the code with "git clone #{your-read-write-url}"

h2. Guidelines:

# Place all your code in a directory named by your first initial and last name.
# Use subdirectories for each language.
# *Do not check in changes to other people's code!* That's just not helpful to anyone.
