DataXu: Seven Languages in Seven Weeks

This repository holds the code exercises of all those at DataXu participating in the Seven Languages in Seven Weeks code-through.

How To Use:

1. If you do not already have a free GitHub account, please create one.

2. Email me (bspaulding@dataxu.com) with your github username, and I'll add you as a contributor.

3. Navigate to https://github.com/bspaulding/SevenLanguages and copy your ssh/read-write url.

4. Check out the code with "git clone #{your-read-write-url}"

Guidelines:

1. Place all your code in a directory named by your first initial and last name.
2. Use subdirectories for each language.
3. *Do not check in changes to other people's code!* That's just not helpful to anyone.
